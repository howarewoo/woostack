# OpenAI (Codex) — Sequential Multi-Angle Review

Codex Action does not expose a subagent primitive. Run the review as a single agentic loop with explicit phases. Use `bash` + `gh` for all GitHub interactions.

The shared header above lists prefetched artifacts, findings schema, blocking criteria, and the do-NOT-flag list. **Apply them verbatim.** Per-angle prompt bodies live at `$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/prompts/angles/<angle>.md` in the bundled action repo.

**Host identifier:** default `codex` (substitute into the credits line `<host>` placeholder per `_header.md`). If invoked from a different OpenAI host, use that host's canonical slug instead.

## Model selection

Codex Action runs one model for the full job. Per-call routing is not possible, so the `tier:` frontmatter on each angle prompt is **informational only** under this provider.

The action resolves one session model in `load-prompt.sh` using this precedence:
1. `FORCE_TIER` from Review Context (from `/woostack-review --fast` or `--deep`, or `review.force_tier` in config): fast→`gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, deep→`gpt-5.5`. Only `fast` and `deep` are valid `FORCE_TIER` values; the `standard` tier (`gpt-5.4`) is the implicit default when `FORCE_TIER` is unset — see step 3.
2. `inputs.model` when explicitly set.
3. Provider defaults (`gpt-5.4` standard).

Per-repo override remains in effect during run-model resolution: if `$OUTDIR/config.json` has `models.openai.<run_tier>` set (or flat `models.<run_tier>`), use that value before falling back to the default.

For quality/cost splits, GPT-5-family reasoning is a `reasoning_effort` parameter, not a slug suffix (`high`, `xhigh` etc.); there is no `gpt-5-pro`. Pass effort via `inputs.openai_effort` (wired through to codex-action `effort`). Use `gpt-5.4-mini` only as the non-spark fallback when Spark is unavailable.

**Per-repo override:** resolve using the active run tier: if `$OUTDIR/config.json` has `models.openai.<run_tier>` set, use it; otherwise fall back to flat `models.<run_tier>` (precedence: `FORCE_TIER` > `inputs.model` > `models.openai.<run_tier>` > `models.<run_tier>` > default `gpt-5.4`). Read with run-tier-aware lookup, e.g. when `run_tier=deep`: `jq -r '.models.openai.deep // .models.deep // empty' $OUTDIR/config.json`.

## IMPORTANT: MODE-BASED EXECUTION

Check the `Execution mode` in the Review Context above.

### MODE: review
You are running as a parallel worker for a specific angle.
- The `Target angle` in Review Context is the only angle you must audit.
- Do NOT post inline comments.
- Do NOT update the PR body or title.
- Do NOT manage labels.
- Run ONLY Phase 2 below for your target angle.
- Write findings to `$OUTDIR/findings.<angle>.json` (default `$OUTDIR/findings.<angle>.json`) and then EXIT.
- The findings file MUST be a JSON array only — starts with `[`, ends with `]`, no preamble, no markdown fences, no commentary. See *Output Discipline* in `_header.md`. Validate every `line` via `scripts/resolve-diff-line.sh` and drop findings the helper rejects.

### MODE: validate
You are running as the final aggregator.
- Read all `$OUTDIR/findings.<angle>.json` files from the disk.
- Perform Phase 3 (Self-Validation) below.
- Perform Phase 4 (Submit Native PR Review) below.
- Do NOT modify the PR title, PR description, or PR labels.
- Exit.

### MODE: full (or detect)
Perform all phases (1 through 4) sequentially.

**OUTDIR handoff.** `$OUTDIR` defaults to a per-project `/tmp/pr-review-<hash>` (derived from the repo's git toplevel by `scripts/resolve-outdir.sh`) so concurrent reviews of different repos on one machine never share a tree. Resolve it ONCE in the orchestrator — `source "$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/scripts/resolve-outdir.sh"` sets and exports `OUTDIR` — then export `OUTDIR` to **every** sub-agent you spawn. Sub-agents prefer the inherited `$OUTDIR`; if it is unset they re-derive via the same helper. Never fall back to a bare `/tmp/pr-review`.

## Phase 1 — Read artifacts + draft summary

Read `$OUTDIR/diff.txt`, `$OUTDIR/meta.json`, `$OUTDIR/angles.txt`. Draft a 1–2 sentence summary, change bullets, files-by-category, optional manual test plan — all destined for the **Review body** in Phase 4. Do NOT call `gh pr edit`; the PR title and description must remain untouched.

## Phase 2 — Per-Angle Audit (sequential loop, chunk-aware)

If `$OUTDIR/chunks.txt` exists (issue #14), the outer loop iterates `(angle, chunk_id)` pairs instead of plain angles. For each pair, read the chunk-specific diff at `$OUTDIR/diff.chunk-<id>.txt` and write findings to `$OUTDIR/findings.<angle>.<chunk_id>.json`. When `chunks.txt` is absent, the inner steps use `diff.txt` and `findings.<angle>.json` as before.

For each angle listed in `$OUTDIR/angles.txt`, in order (× each chunk when chunked):

1. Read `$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/prompts/angles/<angle>.md`.
2. Execute the angle prompt against the angle's diff (full or chunk-specific). For `react` run `npx -y react-doctor@$REACT_DOCTOR_VERSION --diff $BASE_REF --offline`.
3. Write the angle's findings to `$OUTDIR/findings.<angle>.json` (or `findings.<angle>.<chunk_id>.json` in chunked mode) — JSON array conforming to the schema in `_header.md`.

Stay within each angle's scope; do not let `bugs` flag a design issue or vice versa. `merge-findings.sh` (Phase 3) handles within-angle dedup across chunks.

**Retry-once recovery.** Angle iterations can be cut short by tool-stream errors or turn-limit interrupts and leave no findings file. After the loop finishes, scan `$OUTDIR/angles.txt` (× `chunks.txt` when chunked) and check that each expected `findings.<angle>.json` (or `findings.<angle>.<chunk_id>.json`) exists and parses as a JSON array via `jq -e 'type == "array"'`. For any path that fails the check, re-run THAT angle iteration ONCE. Cap is one retry per `(angle, chunk)` pair; if the retry also fails, leave the file as-is and proceed to Phase 3 — the merge step recovers malformed JSON, and missing files just mean the angle produced no findings.

## Phase 3 — Adversarial Validation (prosecutor + defender, sequential)

Merge all `findings.<angle>.json` arrays into `$OUTDIR/raw_findings.json` (use `$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/scripts/merge-findings.sh`).

Then run TWO opposing-bias validation passes followed by a deterministic intersection (issue #13). Codex Action has no subagent primitive, so this is sequenced inside the single agentic loop using `bash` to invoke the intersect script. Read `disable_adversarial` first:

```bash
DISABLE_ADV="$(jq -r '.disable_adversarial // false' $OUTDIR/config.json 2>/dev/null || echo false)"
```

### Phase 3a — Prosecutor pass (skip if `DISABLE_ADV == true`)

Apply `$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/prompts/validator-prosecutor.md` against `raw_findings.json`. Bias: assume each finding is real; drop only the demonstrably wrong. Write surviving findings to `$OUTDIR/findings.prosecutor.json`.

### Phase 3b — Defender pass

Apply `$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/prompts/validator.md` against `raw_findings.json`. Bias: try to prove each finding wrong; drop pedantic / lint-catchable / "maybe" findings; enforce the comment-shape + `fix_type` rules. Write surviving findings to `$OUTDIR/findings.defender.json`. Apply only `validator.md`'s validation/filter rules (its Steps 1–2) to produce `findings.defender.json`; IGNORE validator.md's Step 3/3b/4 and its STOP-GATE — the orchestrator runs the intersect itself in the next phase.

### Phase 3c — Intersect

```bash
bash "$WOO_REVIEW_ACTION_PATH/scripts/intersect-findings.sh"
```

This produces the final `$OUTDIR/findings.json` (intersection by `(file, line, title-stem)`; severity = min, blocking = AND). When `disable_adversarial == true` or the prosecutor file is absent, the script copies defender output verbatim. Per-pass and disagreement counts land in `$OUTDIR/validator-metrics.json`.

## Phase 4 — Submit Native PR Review

Compute `BLOCKING_COUNT`, `NONBLOCKING_COUNT`, `HIGH_COUNT`, `MEDIUM_COUNT`, `LOW_COUNT`. Build `STATUS_LINE`. Follow `_header.md` exactly: submit one batched `gh api repos/<repo>/pulls/<PR>/reviews` POST whose `body` carries the summary + `STATUS_LINE` and whose `comments[]` carries every finding as an inline comment. The review `event` is computed by the `_header.md` payload-builder (do not duplicate the logic here): `REQUEST_CHANGES` when any new finding is `blocking: true` OR when `$OUTDIR/prior-findings.json` is non-empty (unresolved review threads keep the PR at minimum `REQUEST_CHANGES`), `COMMENT` when there are only non-blocking new findings and no unresolved priors, `APPROVE` only when both new findings and prior unresolved threads are empty.

Do NOT call `gh pr edit`. Do NOT add, remove, or mutate PR labels. The PR title, PR description, and PR labels stay untouched.

## Rules

- Execute every phase autonomously — never request confirmation.
- Trust prefetched artifacts.
- Do not interleave audit phases with posting phases.
- `findings.json` is the single source of truth for Phase 4.
