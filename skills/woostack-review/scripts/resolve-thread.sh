# Inputs (env):
#   THREAD_ID   GraphQL node-id of the review thread (required)
#   REPLY_BODY  reply text (required)
#   RESOLVE     1 (default) resolve after replying; 0 reply only
#
# Reply failure (e.g. comment deleted, 422-equivalent) is logged and tolerated:
# the resolve is still attempted so the thread does not linger open.

#   prints "DRYRUN reply <id> :: <body>" / "DRYRUN resolve <id>" instead of
#   calling gh. WOO_REVIEW_FAKE_REPLY_FAIL=1 simulates a reply failure.
