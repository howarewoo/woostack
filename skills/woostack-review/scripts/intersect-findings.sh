# intersect-findings.sh — adversarial validator merge step (issue #13).
#
# Inputs (in $OUTDIR, defaults to /tmp/pr-review):
#   findings.prosecutor.json   array — output of validator-prosecutor.md
#   findings.defender.json     array — output of validator.md (defender)
#   config.json                {disable_adversarial?: bool, ...}
#
# Outputs:
#   findings.json              final validated findings (intersection, or
#                              copy of defender output when adversarial is off)
#   validator-metrics.json     {prosecutor_count, defender_count,
#                               kept_count, disagreement_count,
#                               dropped_by_defender, dropped_by_prosecutor,
#                               mode: "adversarial" | "defender-only",
#                               degraded: bool}
#
# Intersection key: three-pass match. Pass 1 is exact `(file, line, title_stem)`
# where `title_stem` is lowercase alphanumeric truncated to 40 chars — same
# key used by prior-thread dedupe in _header.md so the two stay consistent.
# Pass 2 is a fuzzy fallback for the unmatched remainder: same `file`, line
# within ±10, and `title_stem` matches on its first 20 characters (so minor
# rewording survives). Ties resolved by smallest absolute line delta. Pass 3 is
# a location-only fallback: same `file` and line within ±10 with NO title
# constraint, smallest delta wins, ambiguous ties skipped. It exists because
# cross-angle dedupe in merge-findings.sh can leave the same issue with
# different titles in the two validator inputs, so the title-gated passes drop a
# finding both passes actually agreed on (the bug behind disagreement_count
# inflation). Dropping agreed findings is a worse failure than an occasional
# over-merge, and the merge is conservative (lower severity, AND of blocking),
# so a wrong pairing can never escalate a finding. Together these stop genuine
# agreement from being dropped when the two validators anchor the same finding
# at slightly different lines (e.g. 33 vs 39 for the same REVOKE block) or
# reword the headline past the prefix-20 cutoff.
#
# When `disable_adversarial: true` is set in config.json, OR
# findings.prosecutor.json is missing/empty, intersection is skipped and
# findings.defender.json is copied verbatim to findings.json. This is the
# cost-sensitive opt-out described in issue #13's acceptance criteria.
#
# Merge rules for findings present in BOTH passes:
#   - severity: take the LOWER (more conservative) of the two values
#               (LOW < MEDIUM < HIGH).
#   - blocking: AND of the two (`true` only if both passes say blocking).
#   - other fields (title, description, fix, suggestion, fix_type, rule_quote):
#     prefer the DEFENDER's copy — it ran the stricter shape + fix_type checks
#     so its rewrites are the canonical version.
