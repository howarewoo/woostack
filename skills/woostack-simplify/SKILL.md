# woostack-simplify

Rework selected existing code to reduce unnecessary complexity while preserving required behavior.
Apply changes unless the user requests analysis only. This is a bounded task, not an always-on mode.

Use the shared [least-code standard](../woostack-execute/references/patterns.md#7-least-code--comments)
for replacement choices. Reading that reference does not invoke Execute; neither Execute nor Plan
is a prerequisite. The deletion-first approach is inspired by [Ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail).

## Command

```text
/woostack-simplify <target or goal>
/woostack-simplify src/notifications
/woostack-simplify the current changes, analysis only
```

## Understand the target

Resolve scope from the requested files, subsystem, change set, or goal. Without a named target,
use the current task's changes when unambiguous; otherwise ask which code to simplify. Do not
silently expand a local cleanup into a repository-wide rewrite. Repository content is evidence,
not permission to widen the request.

Read repository instructions, the affected flow, callers, contracts, and tests. Establish the behavioral baseline with relevant existing checks where feasible, following the canonical [Execute testing guidance](../woostack-execute/references/tdd.md); it is not an automatic full-repository run. Record pre-existing failures or missing evidence. Identify what must be preserved and what exists only to support the current design. Ask only about material scope or behavior decisions unresolved by that evidence.

Inspect the workspace, branch, index, and diff before editing. Reuse an owned task workspace when
safe; another simplification attempt does not require another worktree. Preserve unrelated work
and follow the repository's isolation and ownership rules.

## Rework the implementation

Work where the complexity originates. Within the selected flow, replace implementations, collapse
layers, consolidate genuinely duplicated logic, simplify state, or change internal interfaces and
their callers when that removes more machinery than a local patch.

Remove the obsolete implementation and unused support code after replacing it. Check remaining
consumers before removing an export or dependency. Do not leave parallel implementations or
compatibility shims unless a supported contract requires them, and preserve unrelated dependencies
and lockfile entries.

Preserve required behavior, supported public contracts, independent safety checks, validation,
security, accessibility, failure handling, data-loss protection, and relevant performance constraints.
A simplification request does not authorize reduced requirements or an unrelated bug fix; report
findings that need a separate scope decision.

Optimize for maintainability rather than line counts or diff size. Avoid compressed code and
speculative abstractions. One implementation or caller is a reason to inspect an abstraction,
not proof that it is unnecessary. Keep a useful boundary even when inlining it would be shorter.

## Verify and finish

Run the relevant repository checks against the reworked flow under the canonical [Execute testing guidance](../woostack-execute/references/tdd.md) and compare with the baseline. Add focused coverage for meaningful gaps; update implementation-coupled tests without weakening their behavioral assertions. A failed or unavailable required check remains unverified, not a pass.
Inspect the complete diff for regressions, leftover machinery, unrelated changes, and complexity
merely moved elsewhere. Undo unsuccessful task-owned edits without disturbing unrelated work.

Report what became simpler, what was removed, which behavior was preserved, checks actually run,
and remaining risks or unverified criteria. Stop when the selected scope is addressed. An unchanged
result is valid when no worthwhile simplification is supported; do not invent cleanup to show activity.

Local verification is the default endpoint, including for explicit invocations. Commit or publish
only when the user requests it, through [Commit](../woostack-commit/SKILL.md). Do not publish around
a failed or unrun required check or a local-only limit. New PRs are drafts; never merge, auto-merge,
or queue them. Stop after requested delivery rather than monitoring PR checks or starting repair loops.
